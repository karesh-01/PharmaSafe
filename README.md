The pharmaceutical industry's crucial task is to look after the medicines while they are being transported, by ensuring ideal storage conditions and keeping 
track of the complete medications sent to prevent risky scenarios. These three classifications are used by WHO: falsified, substandard, and unregistered/unlicensed. 
The need for sophisticated tools to identify fabricated pharmaceuticals will rise as criminals grow craftier. To identify phoney and substandard drugs, new 
technologies are continually being developed. A substantial lack of transparency in the current system makes it difficult for patients to understand the cost of 
acquired medications, making counterfeit drugs a prime issue. Moreover, if there are accusations of illegal or unethical behaviours, it could be difficult to look into
supply chain tampering. The blockchain technology was employed. Two parties' transactions can be efficiently and permanently recorded using an open, distributed ledger
like blockchain. 

Blockchains are transparent, decentralized, distributed, and unchangeable, which makes them an ideal solution for the problem of fake medications. In 
this project, a system for secure distribution of pharmaceuticals along the whole supply chain is proposed. Using an event request-response method, each product within 
the chain can be transferred between chain associates who have been verified. Smart contracts are used to record all transactions between entities into the blockchain,
allowing a product to be tracked back to its source. The React Framework is utilized to create a DApp. The smart contracts were implemented on a regional blockchain 
that Ganache offered. The Truffle framework and Web3.js is used to connect the DApp to the blockchain. The results of the experiments demonstrate that our technique is
workable and somewhat more secure than current systems.
